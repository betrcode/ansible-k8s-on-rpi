  with_items:
    # Not installing Docker runtime since it is already pre-installed in the Hypriot OS image. Re-enable if we switch to Raspbian.
    #- "docker.io"       # the container runtime, which Kubernetes depends on. v1.11.2 is recommended, but v1.10.3 and v1.12.1 are known to work as well
    - "kubelet"         # the most core component of Kubernetes. It runs on all of the machines in your cluster and does things like starting pods and containers.
    - "kubeadm"         # the command to control the cluster once itâ€™s running. You will only need this on the master, but it can be useful to have on the other nodes as well.
    - "kubectl"         # the command to bootstrap the cluster
    - "kubernetes-cni"
